# Progressbar95 clone (PB95-clone)'
A Progressbar95 clone written in QuickBasic!

It only runs in `SCREEN 0` and automatically adjusts to your display size, so no fancy graphics card needed.

## Compiling
As far as I know it only runs in VB4DOS, as that's what I use as my IDE. But, it likely would work with QB64 and possibly QB45 with enough effort.

Also, you need to load VBDOS.QLB (which is bundled) before running it via the command line:

`vbdos /L VBDOS.QLB`
